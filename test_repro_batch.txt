**Q1** `[TAG: PRELIMS]` `[TOPIC: DISPLACEMENT CALCULATION]` `[Time: 45s]`
**Chetan starts from Point Y and drives 37 km towards the south. He then takes a right turn, drives 18 km, turns right and drives 58 km. He then takes a left turn and drives 61 km. He takes a left turn, drives 21 km and stops at Point Z. How far (shortest distance) and towards which direction should he drive in order to reach Point Y again?**

> (A) 79 km towards West
> (B) 79 km towards East
> (C) 81 km towards East
> (D) 81 km towards West

**Correct Answer:** B

* **Logic:**
* Start Y (0, 0).
* South 37 → (0, -37).
* Right (West) 18 → (-18, -37).
* Right (North) 58 → (-18, -37+58) = (-18, +21).
* Left (West) 61 → (-18-61, +21) = (-79, +21).
* Left (South) 21 → (-79, +21-21) = (-79, 0).
* Final Point Z is at (-79, 0). Y is at (0,0).
* To reach Y from Z, he must travel **79 km towards East**.
